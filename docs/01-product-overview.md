# BLDRpage — Product Overview

## One‑liner
Build, personalize, and publish high‑converting landing pages at scale with AI — for both marketing experiments and sales outreach.

## What is BLDRpage?
BLDRpage is a landing‑page builder that uses AI to create complete pages in minutes. You can personalize every element (headlines, images, buttons, sections) for different audiences, industries, or locations, and publish at scale — without design or engineering work.

## Who is it for?
- Marketing teams running PPC and paid social tests
- Sales, SDR, and ABM teams creating account‑or persona‑specific pages
- Agencies producing many client landing pages quickly
- Multi‑location and franchise brands needing geo‑specific pages

## Problems we solve
- Slow page production and design bottlenecks
- Inconsistent quality across lots of pages
- Hard to personalize pages for each audience at scale
- Limited insight into what’s working and what to change

## What you can do with BLDRpage
- Generate complete multi‑section landing pages with AI
- Personalize copy, images, and CTAs for each audience or data row
- Create hundreds of pages from a simple data sheet (CSV/Sheets)
- Publish to your own domains/subdomains and schedule releases
- Track views, clicks, and form submissions
- Capture high‑quality screenshots for reviews and galleries

## How it works (simple)
1) Describe your page: Tell the AI what you need (product, audience, goal)
2) Get a draft: BLDRpage returns a complete, well‑structured page
3) Tweak visually: Adjust sections, text, and buttons in a no‑code editor
4) Personalize at scale: Connect a data sheet to fill tokens (e.g., {{company}}, {{industry}}, {{city}})
5) Publish & track: Go live on your domain, monitor performance, and iterate

## Key concepts (plain language)
- Page: A single landing page you can share and measure
- Section: A building block (hero, features, testimonials, footer, etc.)
- Personalization token: A placeholder like {{company}} or {{city}} that fills from your data
- Dataset (Variables): Your table of rows used to generate many personalized pages
- Workspace: Your organization’s space with users, pages, and domains
- Document: The editable version of a page in the visual editor

## Typical workflows
- Marketing/PPC: Spin up multiple variants for an offer, test messaging and creative, keep the winners
- Sales/ABM: Create pages tailored to each account/persona with relevant proof and CTAs
- Geo & multi‑location: Generate localized pages for each city/region or store

## Why teams choose BLDRpage
- Speed: Go from idea to a live page in minutes
- Consistency: AI produces well‑structured sections and clean layouts
- Scale: Personalize hundreds of pages safely with brand guardrails

## Personalization (tokens)
Use simple tokens inside text and image fields. Examples:

- Images and CTAs can also vary by row (e.g., different hero image per industry)

## Publishing & tracking
